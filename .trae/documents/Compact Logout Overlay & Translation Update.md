I have completed all requested updates, ensuring consistency and compactness across the UI.

1.  **"My Devices" Sheet (`me_page.dart`)**:
    *   **Compact Style**: Reduced padding, icon sizes, and font sizes to create a tighter layout.
    *   **Consistent Close Button**: Updated the Close 'X' button to match the style of `AddTaskSheet` and `EditTaskSheet` (using `AppColors.surfaceLight` background).

2.  **Sound Effects Item (`me_page.dart`)**:
    *   **Consistent Height**: Increased vertical padding from `12` to `14` to match the "Logout" and "Device Management" items.
    *   **Unified Switch Style**: Updated the `Switch` widget to match the visual style of the `NewTask` sheet (using custom track colors and outline border logic), adapted to the page's primary color.

3.  **Translations**:
    *   Verified and completed English translations for all UI text and comments in `me_page.dart`, `main_page.dart`, and `plan_page.dart`.

The "Me" module is now visually consistent with the rest of the application.
